# BRAINTECT

### What is BRAINTECT?
BRAINTECT is a machine learning based web application that detects brain tumours through MRI scans. It uses CNN model with EfficientNet-B1 architecture as the machine learning model to detect the different types of brain tumours. In BRAINTECT, it is aimed to classify four different types of scans which are ``` Glioma Tumour, Meningioma Tumour, No Tumour and Pituitary Tumour ```. The CNN model scores an accuracy of 98% which is relatively high and also scored well in the evaluation metrics (precision, recall and F1-score), ranging from 97% to 100%.
